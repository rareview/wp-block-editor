# Block Styles

Unlike patterns and blocks, styles are not imported automatically and MUST be added to the `styles/index.js` file for import. While there is no set naming scheme for styles, it currently follows the `namepsace/block-name` model, setting the `namespace` as the directory and `block-name` as the file name. For example, the `core/list` block styles registration would be added to `styles/core/list.js` file and imported in the `styles/index.js` file.
